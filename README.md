This project is a simple Python-based stock portfolio tracker that helps you calculate how much you've invested in various stocks. It uses a predefined dictionary of stock prices and lets the user enter the stock names and quantities they own. The program then calculates the value of each stock and displays the total investment. It also gives the option to save the result into a text file. Through this, I practiced using dictionaries, user input/output, basic math operations, and file handling in Python. Itâ€™s a practical and beginner-friendly project to understand real-world coding logic.
